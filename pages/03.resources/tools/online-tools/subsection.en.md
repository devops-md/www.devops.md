[Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)
Play with Docker (PWD) is a project hacked by Marcos Liljedhal and Jonathan Leibiusky and sponsored by Docker Inc.

PWD is a Docker playground which allows users to run Docker commands in a matter of seconds. It gives the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in browser, where you can build and run Docker containers and even create clusters in Docker Swarm Mode. Under the hood Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs. In addition to the playground, PWD also includes a training site composed of a large set of Docker labs and quizzes from beginner to advanced level available at training.play-with-docker.com.
