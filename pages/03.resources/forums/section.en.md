Got a question about DevOps? Don’t shout it into the ether. Find a kind soul to offer guidance, or share your DevOps lessons learned with others, on one of these web forums.

[Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/devops): A good first step into DevOps includes this all-things-DevOps professional resource forum.

[Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/Forums/aff/1): This forum isn’t DevOps-specific, but the high activity level and overall focus on improving the software development process make it a good place to search for answers and ask for more general advice.

[DevOps Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/devops/md/): There are no active groups for Moldova at this time

Most DevOps software vendors and consultancies operate robust forums that deal directly with questions about their specific products, for example:
* [Docker](https://forums.docker.com/)
* [Puppet](https://ask.puppet.com/questions/)
* [Chef](https://discourse.chef.io/)

Feel free to submit your favorit forums in order to manage an ultimate list of resources ;)
