## Optimize your work with Docker
> Use Docker for backend and frontend develop
 
Dive into the magic world of Docker, exploring its philosophy, methods, and technologies with none others than leading local DevOps specialists!

## Speakers 

### Optimize your work with Docker - foreword

> Speaker: Bezu Igor, DevOps Engineer, SoftwareMind

Igor, in the field of information security, has demonstrated a deep understanding of the threats that can affect the efficiency of companies, successfully implementing robust security measures and best practices to protect critical assets and data, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations in the company .
It was therefore marked by a deep commitment to improving the efficiency, reliability and security of IT operations. Using his expertise in DevOps Engineering, he has consistently delivered innovative solutions that bridge the gap between development and operations departments, simplifying processes and promoting a culture of automation in the SoftwareMind company.

### Fundamental Elements of the Docker Universe 
> Speaker: Veronica Hajdeu, DevOps Engineer, Endava

Veronica is a DevOps engineer with extensive experience in implementing DevOps principles and proficiently using technologies such as Docker and Docker Compose in her project at Endava.
She is actively involved in the development and strengthening of the IT community, having the role of coordinator and mentor in the internship program in the field of DevOps, organized by Endava, thus contributing to the training and development of future talents in the industry. Also, Veronica is an ambassador in the Tech Women Moldova program from 2022, where she contributes to the promotion and support of women in the technological field.

### Dockerization of backend services. 
> Speaker: Andrei Prescornic, DevOps Ingineer, SoftwareMind

Andrei has over 20 years of experience in IT. At the moment he is Technical Director at a multinational IT company. He has Devops experience in dozens of commercial and opensource projects. He has mentored a lot of DevOps Engineers over the years.

### Dockerization of frontend services. 
> Speaker: Berestian Victor, DevOps Ingineer, 

Victor went the path of Jedi, from janitor to CTO, and now Software Engineer. Overall over 16 years of experience ( Backend and FrontEnd). Last 3 years focused on scalable and stable Backend solutions on k8s ( in GoParrot that was bought in 2022 by Jack Dorsey)

## Our goal

To help developers and entuziasts to use docker and docker-compose technologies.
Together, we'll build a buzzing community where students and young professionals can learn, share ideas and grow their skills in the fascinating world of DevOps. We're on a mission to nurture a network of talented individuals who will shape the future of technology and innovation in Moldova.

## Why to use docker in developement?

Docker is a valuable tool in development for several compelling reasons:

1. **Isolation**: Docker allows you to create isolated containers that encapsulate your application and all its dependencies. This ensures that your development environment remains consistent across different stages of the development cycle and between team members. No more "it works on my machine" issues.

2. **Consistency**: With Docker, you can ensure that your application runs consistently across different platforms, including your local development machine, staging servers, and production servers. This minimizes the chances of encountering unexpected problems when moving code between environments.

3. **Portability**: Docker containers are highly portable. You can package your application, its dependencies, and even the underlying OS into a single container image. This image can be easily shared with others or deployed to different hosting environments, such as cloud services or on-premises servers.

4. **Version Control**: Docker images can be versioned just like your application code. This means you can track changes to your development environment and roll back to previous versions if needed. It also simplifies collaboration, as you can specify the exact environment your application requires.

5. **Resource Efficiency**: Docker containers share the host OS kernel, which makes them more resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines. You can run multiple containers on the same host without a significant performance overhead. This is particularly beneficial when developing microservices or complex applications with multiple components.

6. **Fast Deployment**: Docker containers can be started and stopped quickly. This makes it easy to spin up development environments, run tests, and iterate on your code rapidly. It's especially helpful in scenarios where you need to scale up your development environment or run multiple instances simultaneously.

7. **Dependency Management**: Docker simplifies dependency management by allowing you to define dependencies in a Dockerfile or a Docker Compose file. This ensures that all required software and configurations are included in the container, reducing the chances of conflicts or missing dependencies.

8. **Security**: Docker containers provide a level of isolation and security. They restrict access to the host system, which can help prevent unintended interactions between applications and enhance overall system security.

9. **Easy Cleanup**: Docker containers are disposable, meaning you can easily destroy and recreate them when needed. This makes it simple to reset your development environment to a clean state, which is particularly useful when debugging complex issues.

In summary, Docker streamlines the development process by providing consistent, portable, and efficient development environments. It helps you avoid common development and deployment headaches, making it an essential tool for modern software development workflows.

## Software prerequisites for the Workshop 

You will need the following applications on your laptop:

* Docker Desktop sau Engine
* Docker Compose
* Git
* VS Code

We also encourage you to create accounts on GitHub and Docker Hub if you don't have them yet.
