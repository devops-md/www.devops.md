üöÄ Announcing Our DevOps CI/CD Workshop! üöÄ

Installing new application versions can be a difficult process. CI/CD processes are designed to make this process easier. CI - continuous integration allows us to create new artifacts and along the way we try to answer the question of whether the version does not contain critical errors. CD - continuous delivery allows us to install new versions as quickly as possible in testing and production environments, verifying that the new application is working in the predetermined mode. CD is also encountered in the form of continuous deployment, the purpose of which is automatic installation after successful CI. It is the option that any software project would like to reach.

- **Workshop:** CI/CD Workshop
- **When:** 17 February, 2024
- **Where:** [ISD Office](https://isd-soft.com/) (üåé [Directions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sx6AYXzFKJfi99vk7))
- **Registration:** [Unde](https://unde.io/event/267)
